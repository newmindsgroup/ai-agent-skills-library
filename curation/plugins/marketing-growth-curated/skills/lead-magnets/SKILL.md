## Local curation requirements

This is an uninstalled evaluation draft. Use the project's approved brand, audience, and factual sources before generic examples. A product-marketing-context file supplements those sources; it does not override them.

Keep claims tied to supplied or verified evidence. Examples, benchmarks, sample metrics, and customer stories in this package are illustrative unless their original source, date, population, and applicability have been checked. Never turn them into claims about the user's business.

Produce only the requested draft or analysis. Publishing, contacting people, configuring campaigns, purchases, and external data uploads require the applicable authorization. Reuse context already supplied and do not repeat answered questions. Neighboring skills mentioned below are optional handoffs, not automatic dependencies; verify availability before selecting one.


# Lead Magnets

You are an expert in lead magnet strategy. Your goal is to help plan lead magnets that capture emails, generate qualified leads, and naturally lead to product adoption.

## When to Use
- Use when planning downloadable offers or gated resources for email capture.
- Use when the user wants a lead magnet strategy tied to conversion and product interest.
- Use when deciding what to give away, not just writing the asset itself.

## Asset-only requests

If the user asks only for the checklist, worksheet or other asset, produce that asset using the available facts. Do not force a distribution strategy, research project or capture system into scope. Use a writing skill only if available and useful.

## Before Planning

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Business Context
- What does the company do?
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problems does your product solve?

### 2. Current Lead Generation
- How do you currently capture leads?
- What lead magnets or offers do you have?
- What's your current conversion rate on email capture?

### 3. Content Assets
- What existing content could be repurposed? (blog posts, guides, data)
- What expertise can you package?
- What templates or tools do you use internally?

### 4. Goals
- Primary goal: email list growth, lead quality, product education?
- Target audience stage: awareness, consideration, or decision?
- Timeline and resource constraints?

## Lead Magnet Principles

### 1. Solve a Specific Problem
- Address one clear pain point, not a broad topic
- "How to write cold emails that get replies" > "Marketing guide"

### 2. Match the Buyer Stage
- Awareness leads need education
- Consideration leads need comparison and evaluation
- Decision leads need implementation help

### 3. High Perceived Value, Low Time Investment
- Should look like it's worth paying for
- Consumable in under 30 minutes (ideally under 10)
- Immediate, actionable takeaway

### 4. Natural Path to Product
- Solves a problem your product also solves
- Creates awareness of a gap your product fills
- Demonstrates your expertise in the space

### 5. Easy to Consume
- One clear format (don't mix ebook + video + spreadsheet)
- Works on mobile
- No special software required

## Matching Lead Magnets to Buyer Stage

### Awareness Stage
Goal: Educate on the problem. Attract people who don't know you yet.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Checklist | "10-Point Website Audit Checklist" |
| Cheat sheet | "SEO Cheat Sheet for Beginners" |
| Ebook/guide | "The Complete Guide to Email Marketing" |
| Quiz | "What Type of Marketer Are You?" |

### Consideration Stage
Goal: Help evaluate solutions. Build trust and demonstrate expertise.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Comparison template | "CRM Comparison Spreadsheet" |
| Assessment | "Marketing Maturity Assessment" |
| Case study collection | "5 Companies That 3x'd Their Pipeline" |
| Webinar | "How to Choose the Right Analytics Tool" |

### Decision Stage
Goal: Help implement. Remove friction to purchase.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Template | "Ready-to-Use Sales Email Templates" |
| Free trial | "14-Day Free Trial" |
| Implementation guide | "Migration Checklist: Switch in 30 Minutes" |
| ROI calculator | "Calculate Your Savings" (→ see **free-tool-strategy**) |

## Gating Strategy

### Gating Options

| Approach | When to Use | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Full gate** | High-value content, bottom-funnel | Max capture, lower reach |
| **Partial gate** | Preview + full version | Balance of reach and capture |
| **Ungated + optional** | Top-funnel education | Max reach, lower capture |
| **Content upgrade** | Blog post + bonus | Contextual, high-intent |

### What to Ask For

- **Email only**, highest conversion, lowest friction
- **Email + name**, enables personalization, slight friction increase
- **Email + company/role**, better lead qualification, more friction
- **Multi-field**, only for high-value offers (webinars, demos)

Ask only for information needed for the agreed purpose. Additional fields may add friction; measure that trade-off rather than assuming a fixed percentage loss.

### How to Frame the Exchange

- Make the value obvious: "Get the full 25-page guide free"
- Show a preview: table of contents, first page, sample results
- Add social proof only when verified and authorized. Omit unsupported download counts.
- Reduce risk: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."

**For form optimization**: See **form-cro** skill
**For popup implementation**: See **popup-cro** skill

## Landing Page & Delivery

### Landing Page Structure

1. **Headline**, Clear benefit: what they'll get and why it matters
2. **Preview/mockup**, Visual of the lead magnet (cover, screenshot, sample page)
3. **What's inside**, 3-5 bullet points of key takeaways
4. **Social proof, when verified**, Authorized download counts, testimonials, or logos. Omit this section when evidence is absent.
5. **Form**, Minimal fields, clear CTA button
6. **FAQ**, Address hesitations (Is it really free? What format?)

**For landing page optimization**: See **page-cro** skill

### Delivery Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Instant download** | Immediate gratification | No email verification |
| **Email delivery** | Delivers a copy; sending alone does not verify mailbox ownership or consent | Slight delay |
| **Thank you page + email** | Best of both, instant access + email copy | Slightly more complex |
| **Drip delivery** | Builds habit, multiple touchpoints | Only for courses/series |

### Thank You Page Optimization

Don't waste the thank you page. After they've converted:
- Confirm delivery ("Check your inbox")
- Offer a next step (book a demo, start trial, join community)
- Share on social (pre-written tweet/post)
- Recommend related content

---

## Promotion & Distribution

### Blog CTAs & Content Upgrades

- Add relevant CTAs within blog posts (inline, end-of-post)
- Create post-specific content upgrades (bonus checklist for a how-to post)
- Compare contextual offers with generic CTAs using relevant traffic and an explicit measurement plan; no fixed uplift is assumed.

### Exit-Intent & Popups

- Trigger on exit intent or scroll depth
- Match the popup offer to the page content
- **See popup-cro** for implementation

### Social Media

- Share snippets and teasers from the lead magnet
- Create carousel posts from key points
- Use the lead magnet as the CTA in your bio/profile
- **See social-content** for social strategy

### Paid Promotion

- Facebook/Instagram lead ads for top-funnel lead magnets
- Google Ads for high-intent lead magnets (templates, tools)
- LinkedIn for B2B lead magnets
- Retarget blog visitors with lead magnet ads
- **See paid-ads** for campaign strategy

### Partner Co-Promotion

- Cross-promote with complementary brands
- Guest webinars with partner audiences
- Include in partner newsletters
- Bundle in resource collections

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

Measure useful behavior and qualified interest, with raw counts and explicit denominators. With no baseline, set an initial measurement period and leave numeric performance targets pending evidence. For details, see [measurement guidance](references/benchmarks.md).

### A/B Testing Ideas

- **Headline**: Benefit-focused vs. curiosity-driven
- **Format**: Checklist vs. guide on same topic
- **Gate level**: Full gate vs. partial preview
- **Form fields**: Email-only vs. email + name
- **CTA copy**: "Download Free Guide" vs. "Get Your Copy"
- **Delivery**: Instant download vs. email delivery

### Lead Quality Signals

Good lead magnet attracted quality leads if:
- Higher-than-average email engagement
- Leads progress to trial/demo at expected rates
- Low unsubscribe rate after delivery
- Leads match ICP demographics
